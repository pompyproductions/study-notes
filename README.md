# STUDY NOTES REPOSITORY

The notes I take while studying, for future reference/cheatsheet use.
Includes some boilerplate code.

Not in MARKDOWN format, because I find it hard to read through, and double-space everytime is a hassle.
In this style, it is easier to take quick notes.
Haven't really made it into a language yet, but planning to inherit bold and italic.

Had to re-initialize to weed out some sensible information.
