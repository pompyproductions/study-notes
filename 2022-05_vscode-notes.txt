Refactoring code across files

navigate to Edit > Replace in Files
there's an option to "preserve case" (not to confuse with match case)
there you can audit them one by one and apply changes

then you can also git diff to see if all is good (refer to git-notes)


---
Custom Snippets

navigate to File > Preferences > User Snippets
find the language you're looking for (or create one)

format:
	"HTML Comment": {
		"prefix": ["cmt", "comment", "!-"],
		"body": ["<!--$1-->"],
		"description": "An HTML comment."
    }

where the first line is the title that pops up,
prefixes are the keywords that trigger the snippet,
body is what's actually inserted,
and description shows up on the tooltip.

$1, $2 etc are cursor locations.
