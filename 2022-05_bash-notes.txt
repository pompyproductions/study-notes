BASH NOTES
---
Basic Navigation

ls lists files in dir  
just ls will print current dir list  
but you can do ls ../dir/another-dir/etc

arguments;
-a also prints hidden files  
-l lists in detailed strings, 1 per line  
-1 (one) lists 1 file/dir per line, short ver
-R prints all subfolders too (recursive)
you can chain parameters (-1a, -la...)

.. indicates parent dir  
. indicates current dir (apparently means "all in working dir")
also used in git add .
~ indicates root dir

pwd print working directory
cd change working directory  (cd on its own goes to home dir)
mkdir creates new directory  

generally you can do --help when stuck

&& or ; to chain commands (understand && better)

rm is to delete files
can't delete directories UNLESS -r (recursive)
there's also -f to brute force stuff

mv renames and moves files
mv *.txt ~/TextFiles into TextFiles directory in root

cp copies file content,
if second argument doesn't exist it creates a new file (copy paste)

touch creates new empty files

copy-paste: CTRL+SHIFT+C, CTRL+SHIFT+V


---
Processes

top is like a "process task manager"
(htop is an improved version installed through sudo apt)
it is a process on its own that you can quit by hitting q

CTRL+C terminates a process
CTRL+Z pauses a process
bg and fg resume the paused process (as bg or fg)

jobs command lists all working bg processes
kill %[number] terminates the process

nohup ignores the SIGHUP signal, 
so that the program doesn't terminate when the terminal closes
if you didn't do nohup, you can still disown

nohup.log is still annoying since it keeps popping everywhere
so you can ignore output by throwing it to the "black hole":
[example command] > /dev/null 
(specific Linux device that does nothing when written to)

also remember that the redirection operator redirects STDOUT by default
so redirect the STDERR to it as well:
[command] > /dev/null 2>&1

ps shows process history(?), not sure what it stands for

.: Signals (Process pt.2)
CTRL+C sends SIGINT
CTRL+Z sends SIGSTP
NOHUP ignores SIGHUP
KILL sends TERM by default, by passing -l you can see all possible signals
:.

Programs

code [folder|file](VSCode)
firefox [file]
shotwell [file](image viewer)
snap install [program](installer)


---
Installing stuff

sudo for admin privileges (stands for SuperUser DO)
("do" also exists)

fonts;
unzip the file (unzip or tar commands)
then mv *.ttf ~/.fonts

apt
snap

deb;
dpkg -i [file]
-i stands for install


---
Aliases

alias command on its own prints defined aliases

create and delete an alias:
alias testAlias="pwd" (creates alias)
testAlias (runs pwd)
unalias testAlias (deletes alias)

~/.bash_aliases (where custom aliases are saved)
$ source ~/.bash_aliases (to reload the aliases after modifying)

alias indep='x(){
    if [[ -z $2 ]];
    then
        $1 > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
    else
        $1 $2 > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
    fi
}; x'
