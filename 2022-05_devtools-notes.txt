Right click + inspect is easier than f12 + looking around to find the element

Ctrl+shift+p for command line
> dock right/bottom
> undock
> animations
> dark theme
> screenshot (various alts)

Styles pane gives you the whole cascade
under the Computed pane you have a simpler one

you can SEARCH THE DOM TREE (ctrl f):
strings (just content)
selectors (p[color="black"])
xpath (//section/h2)

edit CSS on the fly to prototype
rclick and inspect an element, then change some css on top of cascade
you can auto-complete by value (bold, black, italic, 10px...)

toggle element state (:hov button in styles panel)
also add classes (.cls at same place)

you can click the color squares in styles
it opens up a color picker and also shows contrast ratio
EXPAND IT FOR READABILITY RECOMMENDATIONS!

right click > copy > copy styles (from another page)
and then paste it into your styles, boom it's the same!
